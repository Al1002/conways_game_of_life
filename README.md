A C++ implementation of Conway's game of life.

Includes some generic classes of questionable quality.

Use `./build/main` to run

and

`cmake -S src -B build` to build

`./profiler.sh` - script to view performance with gprof + gprof2dot + xdot. Only works when compiled in debug mode.

This was a technical test for semi-optimized code and usage of a profiler.

Saddly, the work lacks a commit history
